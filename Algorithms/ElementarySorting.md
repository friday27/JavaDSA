# Elementary Sorting

### Selection Sort - O(n^2)
* In iteration i, find the index of the smallest one from the remaining elements. (i+1 ~ end)
* Swap(i, min) so the elements before index i would be sorted.
* [Source code](implementation/SelectionSort.java)

### Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
* In iteration i, swap a[i] with each larger entry to its left.
* [Source code](implementation/InsertionSort.java)
