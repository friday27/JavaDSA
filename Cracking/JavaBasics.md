# Java Basics

* Enum
A Java enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants.

* Garbage collection
When we create an object with "new", Java will allocate a memory space for it, and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will execute garbage collector on its own time.
Garbage collection is to make an unused variable point to null and release the memory space.

### Multi-Thread

* Multi-thread mechanism is to run multiple code blocks at the same time.

* To start multi-thread in a class, we have to make sure
    1. The class is a subclass of **Thread** `class CTest extends Thread {...}`
    2. Write the thread in the method called **run()**
    3. Use `objName.start()` to start a thread

* We can also use `class CTest extends ASuperClass implements Runnable {...}`

* There're 5 statuses of a thread:
    1. Newly created: When the object is instanced
    2. Runable: When `start()` is called, and every thread in this status will compete for CPU resource or stay in a queue
    3. Runnging: When the thread gets CPU and calls `run()`
    4. Blocked: When `wait()`, `sleep(long millis)` or `join()` is called
        * `wait()` is released by `notify()`
        * `objA.join()` means to finish the thread of objA and then run other threads
    5. Dead: When the thread is completed ot `stop()` is called

* We could set and get priority of a thread
    * `void setPriority(int p)`, where p means priority from 10 to 1
    * `int getPriority()`
    * `MAX_PRIORITY`, `MIN_PRIORITY` and `NORM_PRIORITY` could be use along with setPriority()

* synchronized
    * Sometimes when we want to update a static variable using threads, the result might be wrong since thread A and thread B change the variable at the same time and overwrite one of the other result.
    * To avoid this situation, we could use add **synchornized** keyword to the thread

            public synchronized static void add(int n) {...}

    * When we use synchornized, **deadlock** could happen if the synchornized resources is used by a thread and make other threads wating for it.


### Exception Handling
* Try-catch-finally

        try {
            //...
        }catch(ExceptionClass varName) {
            //...
        }catch(Exception e) {
            // Catch all exceptions
        }finally {
            // Whether there's an exception, this block will be executed
        }

* Thorw exception

        if(b == 0)
            throw new ArithmeticException();

        // or throw exceptions in a method
        public static void aaa(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException {
            int c;
            c = a/b;
        }

* Self-defined exception class

        class className extend Exception {
            // ...
        }
