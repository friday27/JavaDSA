    Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns 
    node at the begin- ning of the loop
    
    DEFINITION
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer 
    points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
    
    EXAMPLE
    input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
    output: C
